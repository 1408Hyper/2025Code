> 1408H's source code for the 2025-26 season of VRC.

### Sponsored by [Teehee Dental Works](https://teehee.sg/)

**2025Code** was designed with portability in mind - we understand that situations can quickly change at any competition.  

Our code is hot-swappable, making heavy use of **abstract classes** and **templates**
to allow for us to rapidly change and test different pieces of code when time is of the essence.

Additionally, our code features a [**custom built CI/CD testing suite via GitHub Actions.**](https://github.com/helloworld3200/1408Hyper-2024VRC-Code/actions/workflows/c-cpp.yml) - the only purpose-made one that exists in the entire world at the time of writing.

## Primary Features

- **Custom-built & tuned PID Controller (integrated with IMU, IME and dedicated odometry encoders)** for autonomous routines
- **Multi-mode operator drivetrain control** with easy switching between Arcade, Tank, Curved Arcade including built-in **sinusodial sensitivity smoothing curves**
- **Component-based class system (together with a plethora of base abstract classes)** also provides easier programming of newly engineered subsystems
- *More coming soon further into the season!*

## Included Libraries

- Created with [`PROS` API](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros)
as this has better documentation than the official VEX API.
- Outside of `PROS` and the C++ standard library, our code uses **no external libraries** to write our code - all features are **custom-built** entirely *in-house*.
